Hey, welcome to my page! The page is building now, let's looking forward to it finished~
---
This is Yongchao Zhang (Caron), a master's student from [College of Engineering](http://eng.stu.edu.cn/), [Shantou Univeristy](https://www.stu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computational fluid dynamics, multiphase flow, Lattice Boltzmann Method and Magnetic Fluid Dynamics. As a overview, I listed some of my basic informations in this page : Research Interests, Recent Updates, Education, Honors and Awards as follows.

Also, you can conviniently find informations about my research and publications in the Page of "Research & Publications". 

My CV is available here: [Caron Zhang's Curriculum Viate].
