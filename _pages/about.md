I'm a master's student from [College of Engineering](http://eng.stu.edu.cn/), [Shantou Univeristy](https://www.stu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computational fluid dynamics, multiphase flow, Lattice Boltzmann Method and Magnetic Fluid Dynamics.

You can find my CV here:[Caron Zhang's Curriculum Viate].
