Rosensweig instability is a unique interface instability phenomenon that occurs in conservative systems. Specifically, it arises at the interfaces between magnetic fluid and other fluids when subjected to a magnetic field. This instability typically manifests as spikes along the direction of the magnetic field, while other topological shapes such as rupture and soliton also appear with different levels of magnetic field application.

The primary aim of this research is to investigate the inner mechanisms responsible for the emergence and evolution of the Rosensweig instability in multiphase flow systems. Such insights would have significant implications for the development of effective interface control strategies within various applications of magnetic fluid, such as lubrication/sealing, biomedicine, and liquid robots. Moreover, in this research, we have employed the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method to establish a convenient numerical simulation methodology for investigating this phenomenon.

This research delves into the application of magnetic fluid as a lubricant and sealing technique in various specialized environments, such as space, micro medical devices, and water. In particular, in harsh cosmic environments, the presence of vacuum, radiation, and thermal cycling can lead to disastrous consequences if any leakage occurs. Fortunately, the magnetic properties of these fluids make them a suitable solution for controlling and preventing pollution and leakage...

The focus of this research is enhancing the thermal management of Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) by employing thermoelectric modules on both sides of the PEMFC. A well-designed thermal management strategy can maintain the PEMFC in a relatively stable working state, as temperature fluctuation has a significant impact on the PEMFC's performance.

The thermoelectric device cools or heats the PEMFC by switching between TEC (Thermo-Electric Cooling) mode and TEG (Thermo-Electric Generation) mode, minimizing exposure to excessively high or low temperatures. The developed 3D multiphysics simulation, based on COMSOL, successfully demonstrates the heat distribution of the coupled system and provides a basis for further discussion.
